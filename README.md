# RAG-Pipeline
Creating a Retreival Augmented Generation pipeline. I have created this repository to essentially practice some concepts of RAG pipelines, LLMS and working with  LangChain. This repository is inspired by `Prompt Engineer` on `Youtube`.

### Steps to setup the project
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Set OpenAI API Key environment variable`export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY' >> ~/.bashrc`
3. Start the application `streamlit run app.py`
